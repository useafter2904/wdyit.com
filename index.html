            What happened? <br>
            Someone registered this domain, pointed it at Github, and then deleted their account. Or made a mistake configuring it.<br />
            <br>
            I do not own this domain, contact
            <a href="https://github.com/stefan2904">me</a> if you are the owner and you don't approve of the redirect.
